This is my attempt at making my own simple A* pathfinding in Unity.
Currently the scripts depend on several Unity things, so it will probably not work out of the box.
Some things that work so far:
- Creating a grid in the Unity editor.
- Requesting a path between 2 nodes.
- Generating a path with manhattan-distance

TODO:
- Fix the Euclidean distance path method.
- Remove debug code.
- Remove some references, so the project serves a more general purpose.
